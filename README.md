# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic-Analysis
This project analyzes a heart disease dataset to uncover patterns and correlations in factors like age, gender, cholesterol, and chest pain. Using Python and visualization libraries, it highlights key trends and insights to aid in understanding heart disease risk and its demographic impact.

## 🚀 Objective 
The objective of this project is to analyze a heart disease dataset to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between various factors such as age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Visualizations and statistical analysis are used to explore the prevalence of heart disease across demographic and clinical attributes.

### Problem Statement ❓
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early diagnosis and understanding key risk factors can save lives. This project aims to analyze a dataset containing heart disease attributes to extract meaningful insights that can help in identifying high-risk groups and visualizing critical correlations.

### Conclusion   💡
- Heart disease is slightly more prevalent in males compared to females.  
- Elderly individuals (55+) are at a higher risk of heart disease.  
- Asymptomatic chest pain correlates strongly with heart disease presence.  
- Blood pressure and cholesterol levels tend to increase significantly between the ages of 50-60.  
- Males exhibit higher ST depression and exercise-induced angina levels compared to females.  

Through effective visualizations and analysis, this project highlights the critical attributes influencing heart disease, providing insights that can aid healthcare professionals and researchers in early diagnosis and treatment.
